This portfolio is still under development! Because of that, a lot of projects are still missing, and even this article is unfinished. I will gradually publish more content.

Project candidates for further articles:
- Sending data over light
- Tariq - A knock activated light
- Using RFID cards for macros in music production
- A software to communicate over RS-232 built with Electron
