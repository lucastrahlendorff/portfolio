The idea of the fax: sending documents and messages that the other person can hold in their hand immediately. Isn't there some kind of compromise to retain the charm of analogue technology within the modern world?

What about thermal printers? They are small and fast. That seems like a strange but good idea for a project!

## The Design 
![thermal printer prototype](/images/projects/print-my-messages/prototype.png)

Two buttons, a rotary encoder, a display (2004 LCD, e-paper or OLED) and the thermal printing guts.

I love the ESP32 for it's features and form factor - so I went with it for the logic. Here is the designed UI and it even connects to a MQTT broker:

## Using other printers

But plans change. Why? Because I got my hands on two TM-T20II thermal printers! Business grade, fast, and with automatic cutting:

A [good friend](https://github.com/Syndesi) joined the project. We wanted to integrate the ESP32 into the printer to make it usable with MQTT.

We designed a case for the ESP32 and replaced the drawer port with a usb connector.

Mounted behind the printer it's nearly invisible. Great.
